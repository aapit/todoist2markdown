# Markdown note extractor for Todoist 
Keep your Todoist clean from stuff that doesn't require your focus.

## What it does
This Python script looks for tasks in Todoist tagged with triggers specified by you.
For instance you could use the tag `note`, `recipe`, `movie`, `music`, `idea` or `present`.

It then writes the task content to a Markdown file, using a template. 
Next to the task text it also includes the comments on the task, the labels and its creation date.

Next, the task is completed in Todoist.

## Why?
It enables you to jolt down some quick scribbles, using Todoist's easy interface.
The danger of doing this is that your todo list is polluted with notes.
And these notes don't directly translate into actions.

That's why they shouldn't distract you from what you were planning to do.

You can let this script keep your Todoist spiffy clean on a regular basis.

## QuickStart
### 1. Install repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aapit/todoist2markdown
cd todoist2markdown
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Run `make install` in the project folder to install the `pip` requirements.

### 3. Configure environment
Create a `.env` file and fill it with your config values. You can use `.env.template` as an example.

### 4. Set your routines
Use `routines.template.yaml` as an example to create your own `routines.yaml`.

- In `trigger`, set `tag` to the todo tag that should be converted.
- In `action`, set `dir` to the directory where the Markdown notes should be stored.
- In `action`, setting `appendFilename` to a filename adds a tagged todo item to a bundled note file. In this file, all items with the specified tag are stored. Not setting this parameter creates a new note for every task.

### 5. Tag your todos
Just tag your new task in Todoist with `note`, or whatever smarty-pants tag you will come up with.
For instance by typing `@note` in Quick Add's task text.

### 6. Run the script
Easiest way of running the conversions on your todos is by running in the project folder:
```bash
make
```
This script then turns this type of task into a Markdown file on disk.
From then on, you can search for it when you need a reference.
But no longer being on your radar, you can spend your focus on your actual goals.

You could trigger it from a cronjob to periodically do maintenance on your todos.
